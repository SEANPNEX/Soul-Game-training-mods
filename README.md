# Soul-Game-training-mods

Hi, all. 

This is the repository for some soul game training mods. The mods will change enemy AI and let them repeat one or a group actions. They are intended to enable players who want to get enough trainings of handling some actions of particular enemies. 

## How to use:

The mods here agrees with common mod usage method. Use <a herf="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/332">modengine 1</a>for DS3 mods or <a herf="https://github.com/soulsmods/ModEngine2">modengine 2</a> for both DS3 and Elden Ring mod. The basic structures of these training mods are identical, which is `mod/script/...`.

For modengine 1, install it in the game directory (where you have the `.exe` file) and put the `mod` folder in it. For modengine 2, please refer to their github page.

These training mods are compatible with any mods that does not contain a `/script` file.
